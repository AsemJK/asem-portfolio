                I am a .NET developer, specializing in using the .NET framework
                to build applications. I am proficient in programming languages
                such as C# and skilled in developing web, desktop,
                and mobile applications using technologies like ASP.NET, MVC, .NET CORE, and Xamarin.

                I am also a JavaScript developer, specializing in using JavaScript
                to build web applications. I am proficient in front-end technologies
                like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks
                such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.
                I am also skilled in back-end technologies like Node.js and Express.js.

              As a full-stack developer, I am proficient in both
                front-end and back-end development.
                I have a comprehensive understanding of both client-side and server-side
                technologies and can work on all aspects of an application,
                from the user interface to the database.

                Both .NET and JavaScript development play crucial roles
                in my software development journey, and being a full-stack developer
                allows me to have a broader skill set and the ability
                to work on various parts of an application.

          bio: `I am a seasoned DevOps engineer with extensive experience
                in managing software workflows using GitHub, AWS, and Azure. I have a deep understanding of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and have successfully implemented them using these platforms.

                With GitHub, I have managed code repositories, reviewed code, and merged
                pull requests to maintain code quality and consistency across the team.
                I have also used GitHub Actions to automate software workflows,
                enabling faster and more reliable deployments.

                In AWS, I have leveraged services like AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeDeploy
                for building, testing, and deploying applications.
                I have also used AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure as code,
                allowing me to manage and provision AWS resources efficiently.

                In Azure, I have used Azure DevOps for planning, developing, testing,
                and delivering software. I have also used Azure Pipelines for CI/CD,
                and Azure Resource Manager for managing and organizing resources.

                My experience in these areas has allowed me to streamline software development
                processes, improve team collaboration, and increase deployment frequency,
                all while maintaining high standards of quality and reliability.`,
